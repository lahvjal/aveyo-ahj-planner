# üìÑ Project Update Document: "AHJ Project Browser" ‚Äî App Pivot

## üß≠ Previous Scope (Original Version)
- Build a **map-based app** to help sales reps plan door-knocking routes.
- Focused on **AHJ boundaries** and **classification maps**.
- Early stages included preparing overlays for AHJ territories.

---

## üî• New Scope (Pivoted Version)
The app is now focused on being a **Project Browser Tool** ‚Äî not a knock-planning map.

> **Purpose:**  
> Help sales reps view and filter past solar project installs based on:
> - AHJ classification
> - Utility company classification
> - Financier company classification

‚úÖ This allows reps to make informed decisions about which areas, utilities, and financiers are easier to close deals with ‚Äî based on historical success.

## üõ†Ô∏è New Core Features

### 1. Map View
- Show past installed projects as pins on a map.
- Clicking a pin opens a card or popup showing:
  - Address
  - AHJ name + classification (A / B / Unknown)
  - Utility name + classification
  - Financier name + classification
- Pins are color-coded based on selected classification type.

### 2. List View
- Table displaying all projects:
  - Address
  - AHJ name + classification
  - Utility name + classification
  - Financier name + classification
- Filters to narrow down by AHJ class, Utility class, or Financier class.

### 3. Filters
- On both map and list views, user can:
  - Filter to show only certain AHJ classes (A/B)
  - Filter by Utility class
  - Filter by Financier class

‚úÖ All three filters can be used individually or together.

# ‚úÖ Final Statement
This pivot is designed to make the app **simpler**, **more rep-focused**, and **actionable** based on real historic project data, without trying to predict future territory success through boundary overlays.
